_**This addon is now deprecated due core changes in Cockpit as the same functionality can be achieved without the addon - [issue details](https://github.com/pauloamgomes/Cockpit-CustomComponents/issues/7)**_

# Custom Components addon for Cockpit CMS

Enhances the usage of the field layout by providing the possibility to restrict the available components per field.

## Installation
Install as any other Cockpit CMS addon by extracting to the addons folder (/addons/CustomComponents)

## Usage
When configuring a layout field, set an enabled attribute with a list of component names, e.g.

![Field configuration](https://monosnap.com/image/ZTF0w43zLDcKCXQSpPK30DHhHbR1IQ.png)

So it will restrict the components available when editing the collection entry:
